        ### How Our Adaptive Learning System Works
        
        Our system changes learning content based on:
        
        1. **Age Group**
           - Adjusts vocabulary and concepts for different ages
           - Modifies examples to match interests of each age group
           - Simplifies complex topics for younger learners
        
        2. **Difficulty Level**
           - Beginner: Basic concepts with lots of guidance
           - Easy: Simple concepts with some guidance
           - Medium: More complex concepts with occasional help
           - Hard: Advanced concepts with minimal guidance
           - Expert: Complex projects with independent work
        
        3. **Progress Tracking**
           - Remembers what you've learned
           - Suggests new topics based on your interests
           - Increases difficulty as you master topics
        
        This helps every child learn at their own pace and in their own way!
