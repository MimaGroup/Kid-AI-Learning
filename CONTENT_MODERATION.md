# Content Moderation System

## Overview

The AI Kids Learning platform implements a comprehensive content moderation system to ensure all AI-generated content is age-appropriate for children aged 8-12.

## Features

### 1. Input Sanitization
- Removes potential prompt injection attempts
- Limits input length to prevent abuse
- Strips dangerous characters and patterns

### 2. Content Filtering
- Blocks inappropriate language (violence, adult content, profanity)
- Detects and prevents personal information requests
- Identifies bullying and negative language
- Flags content for admin review

### 3. AI Response Validation
- Validates all AI-generated content before delivery
- Checks for length limits
- Scans for personal information patterns
- Logs flagged content for review

### 4. Safe Prompt Engineering
- Wraps all AI prompts with safety instructions
- Emphasizes age-appropriate content requirements
- Includes explicit guidelines for child-friendly responses

## Implementation

### Content Moderation Utility (`lib/content-moderation.ts`)

\`\`\`typescript
import { moderateContent, validateAIResponse, sanitizeUserInput, createSafePrompt } from '@/lib/content-moderation'
\`\`\`

### Key Functions

#### `moderateContent(content: string, context?: string)`
Checks content against inappropriate patterns and returns moderation result.

#### `validateAIResponse(response: string, endpoint: string)`
Validates AI-generated responses before sending to users.

#### `sanitizeUserInput(input: string)`
Cleans user input before processing.

#### `createSafePrompt(userPrompt: string, ageRange?: string)`
Wraps prompts with safety instructions.

## Severity Levels

- **safe**: Content is appropriate, no issues detected
- **warning**: Minor issues detected, content sanitized automatically
- **blocked**: Serious issues detected, content blocked from delivery

## Flagged Content Logging

All flagged content is logged to the `content_validations` table for admin review:
- Content snippet (first 500 characters)
- Flagged words/patterns
- Context (which endpoint generated it)
- Timestamp and review status

## Admin Review

Admins can review flagged content in the Admin Dashboard under the Content tab:
1. View all flagged content
2. Mark as reviewed
3. Update validation status
4. Track patterns over time

## Testing

Before launch, test the moderation system with:
- Edge cases (borderline inappropriate content)
- Prompt injection attempts
- Various age-appropriate topics
- Different AI models and responses

## Continuous Improvement

- Monitor flagged content patterns
- Update inappropriate patterns list based on real usage
- Refine content replacements
- Adjust sensitivity based on feedback

## COPPA Compliance

This system helps ensure COPPA compliance by:
- Preventing personal information collection
- Ensuring age-appropriate content
- Logging all content for audit trails
- Providing parental oversight capabilities
