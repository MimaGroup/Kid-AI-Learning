## Individual Seed Scripts

If you prefer to run scripts separately:

### Badges Only
\`\`\`sql
-- Run: scripts/006_gamification_system_v2.sql
\`\`\`

### Daily Challenges Only
\`\`\`sql
-- Run: scripts/seed-daily-challenges.sql
\`\`\`

### Quiz Questions Only
\`\`\`sql
-- Run: scripts/seed-quiz-content.sql
\`\`\`

### Premium Activities Only
\`\`\`sql
-- Run: scripts/008_create_subscriptions_schema.sql
\`\`\`

## Verification

After seeding, verify the data was inserted:

\`\`\`sql
-- Check badges
SELECT COUNT(*) as badge_count FROM badges;
-- Expected: 16

-- Check daily challenges
SELECT COUNT(*) as challenge_count FROM daily_challenges;
-- Expected: 30

-- Check premium activities
SELECT COUNT(*) as activity_count FROM premium_activities;
-- Expected: 12

-- Check quiz questions
SELECT COUNT(*) as question_count FROM quiz_questions;
-- Expected: 28

-- View today's challenge
SELECT * FROM daily_challenges 
WHERE active_date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- View all badges by rarity
SELECT rarity, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM badges 
GROUP BY rarity 
ORDER BY 
  CASE rarity 
    WHEN 'common' THEN 1 
    WHEN 'rare' THEN 2 
    WHEN 'epic' THEN 3 
    WHEN 'legendary' THEN 4 
  END;
\`\`\`

## Adding More Content

### Add More Quiz Questions

\`\`\`sql
INSERT INTO quiz_questions (subject, difficulty, age_group, question, options, correct_answer, explanation, points) VALUES
  ('math', 'easy', '6-8', 'Your question here?', '["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"]', 'Correct Answer', 'Explanation here', 10);
\`\`\`

### Add More Badges

\`\`\`sql
INSERT INTO badges (badge_id, name, description, icon, points_required, category, rarity) VALUES
  ('new_badge', 'Badge Name', 'Badge description', 'ðŸŽ¯', 100, 'milestone', 'rare');
\`\`\`

### Add More Daily Challenges

\`\`\`sql
INSERT INTO daily_challenges (challenge_id, title, description, activity_type, target_value, points_reward, active_date) VALUES
  ('challenge_031', 'New Challenge', 'Challenge description', 'quiz', 5, 50, CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days');
\`\`\`

## Content Recommendations for Production

Before full launch, consider adding:

1. **More Quiz Questions** (aim for 100+ per subject)
   - Multiple difficulty levels
   - Various age groups
   - Diverse topics within each subject

2. **More Daily Challenges** (aim for 90+ days)
   - Seasonal challenges
   - Holiday-themed challenges
   - Progressive difficulty

3. **More Badges** (aim for 30-50 total)
   - Subject-specific achievements
   - Seasonal badges
   - Community badges

4. **AI Friend Personalities** (if not already in database)
   - Different character types
   - Age-appropriate personalities
   - Educational focus areas

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
This means the content already exists. The script uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to safely skip duplicates.

### Error: "relation does not exist"
Run the RLS policies script first: `scripts/complete-rls-policies.sql`

### No data showing in app
Check RLS policies are applied and users have proper permissions.

## Next Steps

After seeding:
1. âœ… Test the app with real user accounts
2. âœ… Verify badges are earned correctly
3. âœ… Check daily challenges appear
4. âœ… Test quiz questions display properly
5. âœ… Verify premium content is gated correctly

Your database is now ready for soft launch! ðŸš€
