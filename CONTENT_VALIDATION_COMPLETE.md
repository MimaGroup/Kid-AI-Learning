- **Educational** (5 checks): Age-appropriateness, learning objectives, instructions, feedback, difficulty
- **Technical** (5 checks): No errors, responsive, performance, assets, API calls
- **UX** (5 checks): Visual design, readability, colors, animations, sound

## How to Use

### For Admins:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Content tab
2. Click "Test" on any content item
3. Open the content in a new tab to test it
4. Check off items in the validation checklist
5. Add notes about any issues or observations
6. Submit validation

### Validation Workflow:
1. **Pre-Launch:** Validate all 12 content items
2. **Target:** 100% of content tested, 80%+ pass rate
3. **Action Items:** Fix any failed content before launch
4. **Re-test:** Validate again after fixes

## Launch Readiness Criteria

✅ **Ready to Launch When:**
- All 12 content items tested (100%)
- At least 10/12 items passed (83%+ pass rate)
- No critical bugs or broken functionality
- All educational content is age-appropriate
- Mobile responsiveness verified

⚠️ **Not Ready If:**
- Less than 80% content tested
- Pass rate below 70%
- Any game-breaking bugs exist
- Educational quality concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Run SQL Script:** Execute `scripts/create-content-validation-table.sql` in Supabase
2. **Start Testing:** Go to Admin Dashboard → Content tab
3. **Validate All Content:** Test each of the 12 items systematically
4. **Fix Issues:** Address any failed validations
5. **Re-validate:** Test fixed content again
6. **Launch Decision:** Review overall pass rate and make go/no-go decision

## Metrics to Track
- Total validations completed
- Average scores by category
- Most common issues
- Time to validate each content type
- Pass rate trends over time
