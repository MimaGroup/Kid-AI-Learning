## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Visit all new pages and verify content
- [ ] Test contact form submission
- [ ] Verify footer links work on all pages
- [ ] Check analytics events in browser console (dev mode)
- [ ] Test signup flow with analytics tracking
- [ ] Test login flow with analytics tracking
- [ ] Test subscription flow with tracking
- [ ] Verify error tracking works
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness of new pages
- [ ] Verify all legal pages are accessible

## Compliance Notes

- All pages are COPPA-compliant
- Privacy Policy covers all data collection
- Terms of Service include required disclaimers
- Contact information is clearly provided
- Parental consent requirements are documented
- Data retention policies are specified
- User rights are clearly outlined

## Performance Considerations

- Analytics events are logged locally to avoid blocking
- Monitoring uses performance.now() for accurate timing
- Error tracking includes stack trace truncation
- Event history is limited to last 100 events
- All tracking is non-blocking and async
